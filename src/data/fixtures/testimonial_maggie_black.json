    "body": "In my personal life, I am a daughter, a mother, a sister, a wife, a friend, a counselor, a working woman, etc. Even though and because I know I am all these things, I often forget who I am. I know I will use mindfulness as part of a lifestyle change to focus on my self-care and reconnecting with myself.\n\n I also learned some things I want to practice with my 3 young children to teach them now self-care lessons that will last their lifetime. Life is too short and precious to miss any of it.",
